<h3>ANDROID APP DEVELOPMENT</h3><br>
<img src="ad.jpg" width="200" height="200"><br><br>
<p>Android software development is the process by which new applications are created for devices running the Android operating system. Google states that "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages" using the Android software development kit, while using other languages is also possible.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>ETHICAL HACKING</h3><br>
<img src="eh.jpg" width="200" height="200"><br><br>
<p>Ethical Hacking is an authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security experts to perform such activities in order to test the systemâ€™s defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more importantly, legal.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3><br>
<img src="wd.jpg" width="200" height="200"><br><br>
<p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>UX/UI DESIGNING</h3><br>
<img src="uxui.jpg" width="200" height="200"><br><br>
<p>User interface design or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>3-D PRINTING</h3><br>
<img src="3d.jpg" width="200" height="200"><br><br>
<p>The 3D printing process builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design model, usually by successively adding material layer by layer, which is why it is also called additive manufacturing.</p>
